        <li>1 pound ground sirloin</li>
        <li>8 ounces hot pork country sausage (such as Jimmy Dean)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped garlic</li>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup (such as Campbell's)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen corn kernels</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 (32 ounce) package frozen tater tots</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) with a rack in the center position.</li>
        <li>Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium. Add bacon and cook, stirring often, until browned and crisp, about 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate with a slotted spoon, reserving 2 tablespoons of the drippings.</li>
        <li>Add onion and bell pepper to drippings in skillet; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high and add ground beef and sausage. Cook, stirring, until beef is crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 6 to 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and drain fat, if desired. Stir in soup, milk, sour cream, salt, and black pepper. Stir in corn, bacon, and 1/2 cup of the cheese.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle top evenly with remaining 1 cup cheese and arrange tots in concentric circles over cheese layer (there will be about 1 1/2 cups tots leftover; reserve for another use).</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown and beef mixture is bubbly, about 35 minutes. Let sit for 5 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with parsley and serve hot.</li>
      </ol>
